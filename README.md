# test-repo
A repo to test how to make a repo

## What have I learned so far?

 - We learned that repositories are typically first made remotely on github(you may or may not have to select an owner). Those repos are then cloned locally through vs code or a similar code editor for your local use.
 - Using git add, git commit, and git push you can make and push changes to your repo that will reflect on github.
 - The local clone of the repo can be used offline.
 - Git is a version control software, github is just a site that utilizes git.
