# test-repo
A repo to test how to make a repo

## What have I learned so far?

 - We learned that repositories are typically first made remotely on github(you may or may not have to select an owner). Those repos are then cloned locally through vs code or a similar code editor for your local use.
 - Using git add, git commit, and git push you can make and push changes to your repo that will reflect on github.
 - The local clone of the repo can be used offline.
 - Git is a version control software, github is just a site that utilizes git.

## What have I learned so far part 2?

 - We learned the git flow of git status, git add, git commit to write messages clarifying the changes, and git push to push said changes.
 - The terminology for the git flow is staging.

## What have I learned so far part 3?

 - Git pull allows you to download a remote repos content to be synced with locally.
 - Git add has the -A, -all and . options to add everything changed.
